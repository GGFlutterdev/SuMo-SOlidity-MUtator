# SuMo
SuMo is a mutation testing tool for Solidity Smart Contracts. It features 25 Solidity-specific mutation operators, as well as 19 traditional operators.

SuMo was designed to run mutation testing on Solidity projects in a NodeJS environment. It relies on the interface of the [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) testing framework to compile the mutants and run the tests, and it automatically spawns [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) instances to guarantee a clean-room testing environment between mutants.

Note that [ReSuMo](https://github.com/MorenaBarboni/ReSuMo/tree/main) advances the functionalities of SuMo through:
1. a static, file-level regression testing mechanism for evolving projects;
2. the automatic instrumentation of configuration files (e.g.,```truffle-config.js```) to enable the  Trivial Compiler Equivalence (TCE);
3. a user-friendly GUI.

## Installation
To install SuMo run ```npm install```.

To check the currently installed SuMo version run ```npm run sumo version```.

## Configuration
Before using SuMo you must specify your desired configuration in the [config.js](https://github.com/MorenaBarboni/SuMo-SOlidity-MUtator/blob/master/src/config.js) file.

##### 1) SuMo directories
These fields determine where SuMo stores data during the mutation testing process. Most paths are already set by default:
* ```sumoDir```: path of the directory where SuMo must save the mutation testing artifacts (.sumo by default)
* ```baselineDir```: path of the directory where SuMo must save the baseline of the SUT (.sumo/baseline by default)
* ```resultsDir```: path of the directory where SuMo must save results (.sumo/results by default)

##### 2) SUT directories
These fields specify the path to different artefacts of the System Under Test:
* ```projectDir```: path of the root directory of the SUT where the package.json is located
* ```contractsDir```: path of the directory where the contracts to be mutated are located
* ```buildDir```: path of the directory where the artifacts of the compilation will be placed (usually ``` .../build/contracts/``` )
 
##### 3) Mutation Process
These fields allow to set up the mutation testing process

* ```ignore```:  array of paths to contract files that must be ignored by SuMo during mutation testing
* ```optimized```: employ operator optimizations (true by default),
* ```skipContracts```: array of paths to contract files (or contract folders) that must be ignored by SuMo during mutation testing
*  ```skipTests```:   array of paths to test files that must be ignored by SuMo 
* ```tce```: enable the Trivial Compiler Equivalence (true by default),
* ```testingTimeOutInSec```: number of seconds after which a mutant is marked as timed-out during testing (300 by default)

##### 4) Testing Interface
These fields specify what  testing framework and blockchain simulator SuMo should use to conduct mutation testing:
* ```network```: the blockchain simulator to be used. Available options are:
  * ```ganache```: use the Ganache installation of SuMo;
  * ```none```
* ```testingFramework```: the testing framework to be used for compiling and testing the smart contracts. Available options are:
  * ```truffle```: use the Truffle installation of SuMo;
  * ```hardhat```: use the Hardhat installation of SuMo;
  * ```custom```: use a custom compile and test script specified in the package.json of the project under test;

Note that:
* When selecting a specific testing framework (e.g., truffle):
  * SuMo will use its own installation of the framework to test the contracts, but it will still use the configuration file (e.g., ```truffle-config.js```) defined in your SUT;
  * The smart contracts will be compiled with a default command  (e.g., ```truffle compile``` );
  * The smart contracts will be tested with a default test command followed by the names of the test files to be executed and the bail option (e.g., ```truffle test ...testFiles -b``` ) 
  
* When choosing ```custom```: 
   * SuMo will invoke the ```compile``` and ```test``` script defined in the ```package.json``` of the SUT. This allows you to have more control over the testing process; 
   * The smart contracts will be tested with your custom test script followed by the names of the test files to be  executed;
   * Make sure to install the reuired dependencies in your SUT, and to define such scripts before starting the testing process.

##### 5) Trivial Compiler Equivalence

The Trivial Compiler Equivalence compares the bytecode produced by the compiler to detect equivalences between mutants, thus it can only work if:
1. the solc compiler optimization is enabled;
2. no metadata hash is appended to the contract bytecode.

Before running SuMo make sure that the following options are present in your ```truffle-config.js``` configuration file:

```
 compilers: {
    solc: {
        optimizer: {
            enabled: true,
            ...
        },
        metadata: {
              bytecodeHash: "none"
        }
      }
  }
```


## CLI Usage

#### Selecting Mutation Operators
Before starting the mutation process you can choose which mutation operators to use:
* ```npm run sumo list``` shows the currently enabled mutation operators
* ```npm run sumo enable``` enables all the mutation operators
* ```npm run sumo enable [ID]``` enables the mutation operator ID
* ```npm run sumo disable``` disables all the mutation operators
* ```npm run sumo disable [ID]``` disables the mutation operator ID

#### Viewing the available mutations
Once everything is set up you can use:
* ```npm run sumo preflight``` To view the available mutations and save a preliminary report  to ./sumo/report.txt
* ```npm run sumo mutate``` To view the available mutations, save a preliminary report  to ./sumo/report.txt, and save a copy of each mutant to ./sumo/mutants
* * ```npm run sumo diff [hash]``` To view the difference between the mutant identified by hash and its original contract

#### Running Mutation Testing
Use:
* ```npm run sumo test``` To launch the mutation testing process;
* ```npm run sumo restore``` To restore the SUT files to a clean version if you suddenly interrupt the mutation process. Note that the restore command overwrites the content of the project under test with the files stored in the ```.sumo/baseline``` folder.
If you need to restore the project files, make sure to do so before performing other operations as the baseline is automatically refreshed on subsequent preflight or test runs.

### Results
SuMo automatically creates a ```.sumo\results``` folder in the root directory of the project. <br/>
SuMo generates the following reports:
* ```report.txt``` Provides information about the whole testing process
* ```operators.xlsx``` Provides the results of the mutation testing process for each operator
* ```generated.csv``` Provides detailed information about the generated mutants
* ```results.csv``` Provides the mutation testing results for each mutant. This synchronous log is updated each time a mutant is assigned a status
*  ```summary.csv``` Provides a summary of the mutation testing results
* ```\alive``` Mutants that survived testing
* ```\killed``` Mutants killed by tests
* ```\equivalent``` Equivalent mutants discarded by the TCE
* ```\redundant``` Redundant mutants discarded by the TCE
* ```\stillborn``` Stillborn mutants
* ```\timedout``` Timedout mutants
* ```\mutants``` Mutated contracts

Use:
* ```npm run sumo cleanSumo``` to delete the ```.sumo``` folder;

## Mutation Operators ðŸ‘¾

SuMo includes currently 25 Solidity-specific operators and 19 general operators, some of which foresee an Optimized version.

* The standard, **Non-Optimized** operators include extended mutation rules capable of generating a more comprehensive collection of mutants. The Non-Opt operators guarantee higher reliability at the price of a more expensive and time-consuming mutation testing process. 
* The **Optimized** operators consist of simplified rules to limit the generation of likely subsumed mutants and speed up the testing process.
