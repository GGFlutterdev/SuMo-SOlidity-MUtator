# SuMo
SuMo is a mutation testing tool for Solidity Smart Contracts. It features 25 Solidity-specific mutation operators, as well as 19 traditional operators.

SuMo was designed to run mutation testing on Solidity projects in a NodeJS environment. It relies on the interface of the [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) testing framework to compile the mutants and run the tests, and it automatically spawns [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) instances to guarantee a clean-room testing environment between mutants.

Note that [ReSuMo](https://github.com/MorenaBarboni/ReSuMo/tree/main/src) advances the functionalities of SuMo through:
1. a static, file-level regression testing mechanism for evolving projects
2. the usage of the Trivial Compiler Equivalence (TCE) for automatically detecting and discarding mutant equivalencies

## Installation
To install SuMo run ```npm install```.

## Configuration
Before using SuMo you must specify your desired configuration in the [config.js](https://github.com/MorenaBarboni/SuMo-SOlidity-MUtator/blob/master/src/config.js) file.

##### 1) SuMo directories
These fields determine where SuMo stores data during the mutation testing process. Most paths are already set by default:
* ```sumoDir```: path of the directory where SuMo must save the mutation testing artifacts (.sumo by default)
* ```baselineDir```: path of the directory where SuMo must save the baseline of the SUT (.sumo/baseline by default)
* ```killedDir```: path of the directory where SuMo must save the killed mutations (.sumo/killed by default)
* ```aliveDir```: path of the directory where SuMo must save the live mutations (.sumo/alive by default)
* ```mutantsDir```: path of the directory where SuMo must (optionally) save a copy of each mutated contract (.sumo/mutants by default)

##### 2) SUT directories
These fields specify the path to different artefacts of the System Under Test:
* ```projectDir```: path of the root directory of the SUT where the package.json is located
* ```contractsDir```: path of the directory where the contracts to be mutated are located
* ```buildDir```: path of the directory where the artifacts of the compilation will be placed (usually ``` .../build/contracts/``` )
 
##### 3) Mutation Process
These fields allow to set up the mutation testing process

* ```bail```: bail after the first test failure (false by default)
* ```customTestScript```: use a custom compile and test script specified in the package.json of the SUT, instead of relying on the Truffle    interface (false by default)
* ```ganache```: automatically spawn Ganache instances during the testing process (true by default)
* ```ignore```:  array of paths to contract files that must be ignored by SuMo during mutation testing
* ```optimized```: employ operator optimizations (true by default),
* ```tce```: enable the Trivial Compiler Equivalence (true by default),
* ```testingTimeOutInSec```: number of seconds after which a mutant is marked as timed-out during testing (300 by default)

Note that if ```customTestScript``` is true you must specify a ```test``` and ```compile``` script in your ```package.json``` file.
When using a custom test script the ```bail``` field of SuMo is ignored; it must be added to the custom script itself.

##### 4) Trivial Compiler Equivalence

The Trivial Compiler Equivalence compares the bytecode produced by the compiler to detect equivalences between mutants, thus it can only work if:
1. the solc compiler optimization is enabled;
2. no metadata hash is appended to the contract bytecode.

Before running SuMo make sure that the following options are present in your ```truffle-config.js``` configuration file:

```
 compilers: {
        solc: {
            optimizer: {
                enabled: true,
                ...
            },
			metadata: {
            bytecodeHash: "none"
          }
        }
    }
```


## CLI Usage

#### Selecting Mutation Operators
Before starting the mutation process you can choose which mutation operators to use:
* ```npm run sumo list``` shows the currently enabled mutation operators
* ```npm run sumo enable``` enables all the mutation operators
* ```npm run sumo enable ID``` enables the mutation operator ID
* ```npm run sumo disable``` disables all the mutation operators
* ```npm run sumo disable ID``` disables the mutation operator ID

#### Viewing the available mutations
Once everything is set up you can use:
* ```npm run sumo preflight``` To view the available mutations and save a preliminary report  to ./sumo/report.txt
* ```npm run sumo mutate``` To view the available mutations, save a preliminary report  to ./sumo/report.txt, and save a copy of each mutant to ./sumo/mutants

#### Running Mutation Testing
Use:
* ```npm run sumo test``` To launch the mutation testing process;
* ```npm run sumo restore``` To restore the SUT files to a clean version if you suddenly interrupt the mutation process

### Results
SuMo automatically creates a ```.sumo``` folder in the root directory of the project. <br/>
At the end of the mutation testing process the folder will contain:
* ```report.txt``` Test report
* ```operators.xlsx``` Mutation operators report
* ```\alive``` Mutants that survived testing
* ```\killed``` Mutants killed by tests
* * ```\equivalent``` Equivalent mutants discarded by the TCE
* ```\redundant``` Redundant mutants discarded by the TCE
* ```\mutants``` Mutated contracts

Use:
* ```npm run sumo cleanSumo``` to delete the ```.sumo``` folder;

## Mutation Operators ðŸ‘¾

SuMo includes currently 25 Solidity-specific operators and 19 general operators, some of which foresee an Optimized version.

* The standard, **Non-Optimized** operators include extended mutation rules capable of generating a more comprehensive collection of mutants. The Non-Opt operators guarantee higher reliability at the price of a more expensive and time-consuming mutation testing process. 
* The **Optimized** operators consist of simplified rules to limit the generation of likely subsumed mutants and speed up the testing process.
