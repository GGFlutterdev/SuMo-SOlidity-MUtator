# SuMo
SuMo is a mutation testing tool for Solidity Smart Contracts. It features 25 Solidity-specific mutation operators, as well as 19 traditional operators.

SuMo was designed to run mutation testing on Solidity projects in a NodeJS environment. It can run test using [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [Forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry). If needed, SuMo can also automatically spawn [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) instances to guarantee a clean-room testing environment between mutants.

## Installation

To install sumo run ```npm install @morenabarboni/sumo```

## Configuration
Before using SuMo you must specify your desired configuration in a [sumo-config.js](https://github.com/MorenaBarboni/SuMo-SOlidity-MUtator/blob/master/src/sumo-config.js) in the root directory of your project. The ```sumo-config.js``` is automatically generated upon installation.

Here's a simple example of ```sumo-config.js```:

```
module.exports = {
  buildDir: 'build',
  contractsDir: 'contracts',
  testDir: 'test',
  skipContracts: ['contractName.sol'],
  skipTests: ['testDir/testFileName.js'],
  testingTimeOutInSec: 300,
  network: "none",
  testingFramework: "truffle",
  optimized: false,
  tce: false
}
```

##### 1) SUT directories
These (optional) fields idenitfy relevant project directories.
* ```contractsDir```: relative path to the directory where the contracts to be mutated are located (contracts by default);
* ```testDir```: relative path to the directory where the tests to be evaluated are located (test by default);
* ```buildDir```: relative path to the directory where the artifacts of the compilation will be saved (build, out or artifacts by default);
 
##### 2) Mutation Process
These fields allow to configure the mutation testing process:
* ```optimized```: employ operator optimizations (false by default),
* ```skipContracts```: array of relative paths to contract files (or folders) that must be ignored by SuMo during mutation testing;
*  ```skipTests```:   array of relative paths to test files (or folders) that must be ignored by SuMo;
* ```tce```: enable the Trivial Compiler Equivalence (false by default);
* ```testingTimeOutInSec```: after how many seconds a mutant is marked as timed-out during testing (300 by default).

##### 3) Testing Interface
These fields specify what testing framework and blockchain simulator SuMo should use to conduct mutation testing:
* ```network```: the blockchain simulator to be used. Available options are:
  * ```ganache```: use the Ganache installation of the SUT;
  * ```none```: do not use a blockchain simulator;
* ```testingFramework```: the testing framework to be used for compiling and testing the smart contracts. Available options are:
  * ```brownie```: use a global/local installation of Brownie;
  * ```forge```: use a global installation of Forge;
  * ```hardhat```: use the Hardhat installation of the SUT;
  * ```truffle```: use the Truffle installation of the SUT;
  * ```custom```: use a custom compile and test script specified in the package.json of the SUT.

Note that:
* When choosing ```truffle``` or ```hardhat```:
  * SuMo will rely on the local ```truffle``` or ```hardhat``` package installed in the project;
  * The smart contracts will be compiled with a minimal compile command  (e.g., ```truffle compile``` );
  * The smart contracts will be tested with a minimal test command followed by the bail option, and (optionally) by a list of test files to be executed (e.g., ```truffle test ...testFiles -b```) .

* When choosing ```brownie```:
  * SuMo will rely on a local/global ```brownie``` installation;
  * The smart contracts will be compiled with a minimal compile command  (e.g., ```brownie compile``` );
  * The smart contracts will be tested with a minimal test command followed by the exitfirst option, and (optionally) by a list of test files to be executed (e.g., ```brownie test ...testFiles --exitfirst```) .

* When choosing ```forge``` :
  * SuMo will rely on the global installation of ```foundry```;
  * The smart contracts will be compiled with a minimal compile command  (e.g., ```forge build```);
  * The smart contracts will be tested with a minimal test command, optionally followed by a list of test files to be executed (e.g., ```forge test ...testFiles```).
  
* When choosing ```custom```: 
  * SuMo will invoke the ```compile``` and ```test``` script defined in your ```package.json```. This allows you to customize both scripts and have more control over the testing process; 
  * The ```skipTests``` list will be overridden by the ```test``` script in your ```package.json```. To skip some test files, you can either: 1) append the specific test files you want to run to your ```test``` script, or 2) remove the test files to be skipped from the test folder.
  * The ```--bail```/```--exitfirst``` option should be added to the test script to speed up mutation testing. 

## Trivial Compiler Equivalence

The Trivial Compiler Equivalence compares the smart contract bytecode to detect equivalences between mutants and it can only work if:
1. the solc compiler optimization is enabled;
2. no metadata hash is appended to the contract bytecode.

##### 1) TCE for Truffle and Hardhat
If your ```testingFramework``` is ```truffle``` or ```hardhat```, you must add the following to your ```truffle-config.js``` or ```hardhat.config.js``` file:

```
 compilers: {
    solc: {
        optimizer: {
            enabled: true,
            runs: 200
            ...
        },
        metadata: {
              bytecodeHash: "none"
        }
      }
  }
```

##### 2)TCE for Brownie
If your ```testingFramework``` is ```brownie```, you must add the following to your ```brownie-config.yaml``` file:

```
compiler:
    solc:
        optimize: true
        runs: 200
```

##### 3) TCE for Forge
If your ```testingFramework``` is ```forge```  you must add the following to your ```foundry.toml``` file:

```
optimizer = true
optimizer-runs = 200
```

##### 4) TCE for Hybrid Test Suites
If your ```testingFramework``` is ```custom``` but you still rely on a single testing framework you can refer to the previous sections.

However, if you are using ```custom``` to evaluate hybrid test suites (e.g., ```forge``` and ```hardhat```) you must make sure that the sumo configuration is consistent.

For example, consider the following package.json scripts:

```
 scripts: {
    compile: "hardhat compile",
    test "hardhat test --bail && forge test"
 }
```
If you make SuMo use hardhat to compile the contracts, make sure that the ```buildDir``` points to the hardhat compiled artifacts and not to the forge ones, and vice versa.

## CLI Usage

#### Selecting Mutation Operators
Before starting the mutation process you can choose which mutation operators to use:
* ```npx/yarn sumo list``` shows the currently enabled mutation operators
* ```npx/yarn sumo enable``` enables all the mutation operators
* ```npx/yarn sumo enable ID``` enables the mutation operator(s) by ID
* ```npx/yarn sumo disable``` disables all the mutation operators
* ```npx/yarn sumo disable ID``` disables the mutation operator(s) by ID

#### Viewing the available mutations
Once everything is set up you can use:
* ```npx/yarn sumo preflight``` To view the available mutations and save a preliminary report  to ./sumo/report.txt
* ```npx/yarn sumo mutate``` To view the available mutations, save a preliminary report  to ./sumo/report.txt, and save a copy of each mutant to ./sumo/mutants
* ```npx/yarn sumo diff [hash]``` To view the difference between the mutant identified by hash and its original contract

#### Running Mutation Testing
Use:
* ```npx/yarn sumo pretest``` To ensure that the test suite can be successfully evaluated before running mutation testing.
* ```npx/yarn sumo test [startHash] [endHash]``` To launch the mutation testing process; You can optionally choose an interval of mutants to be tested by sepcifying ```startHash``` and ```endHash```.
* ```npx/yarn sumo restore``` To restore the SUT files to a clean version if you suddenly interrupt the mutation process. Note that the restore command overwrites the content of the SUT with the files stored in the ```.sumo/baseline``` folder.
If you need to restore the project files, make sure to do so before performing other operations as the baseline is automatically refreshed on subsequent preflight or test runs.

### Results
SuMo automatically creates a ```.sumo\results``` folder in the root directory of the project with the following reports: <br/>
* ```report.txt``` Provides information about the whole testing process
* ```operators.xlsx``` Provides the results of the mutation testing process for each operator
* ```generated.csv``` Provides detailed information about the generated mutants
* ```results.csv``` Provides the mutation testing results for each mutant. This synchronous log is updated each time a mutant is assigned a status
*  ```summary.csv``` Provides a summary of the mutation testing results
* ```\alive``` Mutants that survived testing
* ```\killed``` Mutants killed by tests
* ```\equivalent``` Equivalent mutants discarded by the TCE
* ```\redundant``` Redundant mutants discarded by the TCE
* ```\stillborn``` Stillborn mutants
* ```\timedout``` Timedout mutants
* ```\mutants``` Mutated contracts

## Mutation Operators ðŸ‘¾

SuMo includes currently 25 Solidity-specific operators and 19 general operators, some of which foresee an Optimized version.

* The **Default** operators include extended mutation rules capable of generating a more comprehensive collection of mutants. These operators guarantee higher reliability at the price of a more expensive and time-consuming mutation testing process. 
* The **Optimized** operators consist of simplified rules to limit the generation of likely subsumed mutants and speed up the testing process.
